 Fortress Project
----------------------------------------------------------------

 Project structure:

 In the Fortress project, production code and unit tests are separated and
 located in the following folders respectively:

  'src/main/java'
  'src/test/java'

 The package structure of unit tests replicated the package structure of
 production code. I.e. unit test are located in the same packages as the classes
 they are intended to test.

----------------------------------------------------------------

 Preparing the project:

 1. Check out the project from the Subversion repository:

    svn checkout http://forge.ispras.ru/svn/solver-api

 2. Download common files required to build the project:

    cd solver-api/trunk/fortress/
    ant -f setup.xml

    All required files will be downloaded to the "tools" folder. Including:
      - Main build file: 'tools/buildbase/buildbase.xml'.
      - Build property file: 'tools/buildbase/buildbase.properties'.
      - Archived build files: tools/buildbase.zip (including the buildbase.txt file containing brief information on BuildBase).
      - Runtime dependencies: the 'libs' folder (at the moment, Fortress does not have runtime dependencies).

----------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Building the project:

 1. To build the JAR file, execute the following command:

    ant distr.jar

 2. To run unit tests, execute the following command:

    ant test

 3. To generate JavaDoc documentation, execute the following command:

    ant javadoc

 Junit and Z3 are automatically downloaded to the 'tools' folder. Their version numbers are specified in the ivy.xml file.
