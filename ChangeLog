 Fortress Builds
================================================================================

 Fortress (FORmula TRanslation, Evaluation and Symbolic Simplification), former
 JCSA (Java Constraint Solver API), is an open-source and extendable Java
 library providing facilities for manipulation with formulae (terms and
 constraints). The library allows creating formulae (in the form of syntax
 trees), translating them into external formats (programming languages, XML,
 SMT-LIB, etc.), evaluating them and doing symbolic simplification. It also
 supports constraint solving using built-in solvers as well as external ones
 (like Yices, Z3, CVC4, etc.)
