 Fortress Builds
================================================================================

 Fortress (FORmula TRanslation, Evaluation and Symbolic Simplification), former
 JCSA (Java Constraint Solver API), is an open-source and extendable Java
 library providing facilities for manipulation with formulae (terms and
 constraints). The library allows creating formulae (in the form of syntax
 trees), translating them into external formats (programming languages, XML,
 SMT-LIB, etc.), evaluating them and doing symbolic simplification. It also
 supports constraint solving using built-in solvers as well as external ones
 (like Yices, Z3, CVC4, etc.)

 XXXX/XX/XX Fortress 0.3.2 beta (to be released)

 The following features have been implemented:

 - Factory methods to simplify creating NodeValue objects
 - Support for creating deep copies of expressions
 - Utility classes for generating random values
 - Support for a variable number of operands in the expression calculator
 - Saving/loading constraints to/from an XML string
 - Aborting visiting an expression tree and skipping subtrees
 - Basic facilities to calculate the type of an expression
 - Extending the functionality of a solver with function templates
 - New standard operations: ABS, MIN, MAX, BVANDR, BVNANDR,
   BVORR, BVNORR, BVXORR, BVXNORR
 - Class NodeExpr was renamed to NodeOperation
 - XML format was simplified: nodes Expression and Operation were merged
   together (the new node is called Operation)
 - Class ExprUtils that provides a set of useful methods to work with
   logical expressions
 - Expression printers for Verilog and VHDL hardware description languages

 - New classes for describing data were implemented 
   (including a new bit vector implementation)
 - A lot of refactoring has been done
 - A number of bugs was fixed

 2013/04/11 Java Constraint Solver API 0.1.1 beta
  
 Features offered by the build:

 - Constraints mapping to the SMT-LIB description (in this version
   only binary operations are supported)
 - Constraints storing in external memory (as XML files)
 - Z3 solver launching and transferring results back to Java
